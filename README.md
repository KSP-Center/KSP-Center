Hello, I am KSP-Center, and welcome to my profile!
As someone who is still in school, I am still learning the world around me.
I'm a part-time programmer, as I am part of a team in the VEX Robotics Competition!
Unfortinatly I'm not the main programmer, as another person on the team knows a bit more coding than I do.
As of right now, I am currently programming in C++ (as someone in robotics would know).
I plan to eventually learn C# for Unity and Windows GUI Projects, Swift for iOS apps, and maybe Lua for Roblox scripting.
Something to add on is I do wanna learn terminal commands, specifically for Windows and Linux-based OS's.
I also enjoy other activites I do. Im not one of those people who stare at a screen 24/7 lol.
I'm currently a member of several school bands, including Concert and Marching Band.
This year, I did one year of Jazz band on the drums, but I decided that was enough.

All of the programs for robotics starting in 2024 will be posted here.
You may download it as you wish! I may or may not also include other projects I'm working on.
